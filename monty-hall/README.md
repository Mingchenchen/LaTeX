# Wikipedia article in LaTeX #

I held a LaTeX course in 2013 and decided to use the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) article of the
[Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
as an example. All participants got the article as plain text and we
tried to translate it into LaTeX code.

So the students learned about several available packages and used
different techniques. The article itself based on a version from
[end of June in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monty_Hall_problem&oldid=561421917). So
it might have changed when you read it now.
